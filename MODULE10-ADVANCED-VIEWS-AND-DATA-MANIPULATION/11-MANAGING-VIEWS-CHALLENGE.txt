In this challenge, we use again
 the view v_customer_info that we have
  previously created:



CREATE VIEW v_customer_info
AS
SELECT cu.customer_id,
    cu.first_name || ' ' || cu.last_name AS name,
    a.address,
    a.postal_code,
    a.phone,
    city.city,
    country.country
     FROM customer cu
     JOIN address a ON cu.address_id = a.address_id
     JOIN city ON a.city_id = city.city_id
     JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
ORDER BY customer_id



You need to perform the following tasks:

1) Rename the view to v_customer_information.


ALTER VIEW v_customer_info
RENAME TO v_customer_information;




2) Rename the customer_id column to c_id.


ALTER VIEW v_customer_information
RENAME COLUMN customer_id TO c_id;



3) Add also the initial column as the third column to the view by replacing the view.



CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_customer_information
AS
SELECT cu.customer_id,
    cu.first_name || ' ' || cu.last_name AS name,
    CONCAT(LEFT(cu.first_name,1),LEFT(cu.last_name,1)) as initials,
    a.address,
    a.postal_code,
    a.phone,
    city.city,
    country.country
     FROM customer cu
     JOIN address a ON cu.address_id = a.address_id
     JOIN city ON a.city_id = city.city_id
     JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
ORDER BY customer_id
