If you experience very slow performance in pgAdmin, you can make one important adjustment.

Make sure pgAdmin is closed.

1. Open the folder C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\data

Replace '14' with your version that you are using if it is not 14.

2. Open the file postgresql.conf by right-clicking it and selecting "Edit" or "Edit with Notepad++".

You can also install Notepad++ if you don't have this option.

3. Press 'CTRL + F' and search for listen_addresses and replace '*' with '127.0.0.1,::1'


4. Save the file.

5. Open pgAdmin and your performance should be much better now!
